# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm USA

### ðŸš€ Senior Security Systems Engineer
#### Here's a brief overview of what I do
* I architect cloud-based systems for companies that are based on these tenets: 
   * **Resiliency** - If something "goes wrong" in the code; the program is able to self-heal or continue without affecting the entire system itself.
   * **Highly-available** - The system is *ideally* available at all times; the system converges towards an error-free state and is therefore self stabilizing.
   * **Redundancy** - There ~~should~~ will always be multiple identical instances of the system and it will switch to one of the redundant instances in case of failover.
   * **Efficiency** - The above three cost a lot to achieve; my designs are extremely efficient. If there is too much code, complexity, both, or either, I will revert the changes and re-create the system until it is. Being efficient and having all three of the above is a requirement. Until that is achieved my work is not complete.
 * I do a bunch of other stuff regarding **GDPR, CCPA in addition to FINRA, SOX and PCI-DSS** compliance, however, since this is Github, I will leave it at that!

* In today's society we are constantly barraged with a "firehouse" of information daily. Our purpose is to help educate citizens on identifying fake news, learning skills to critically assess what they are reading, and lastly, be able to access resources that would otherwise be behind a "paywall" for free. We went public in January of 2021.
