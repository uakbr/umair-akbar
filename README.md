# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Umair

### ðŸš€ Senior Security Systems Engineer
#### Here's a brief overview of what I do
* I architect cloud-based systems for companies that are based on these tenets: 
   * **Resiliency** - If something "goes wrong" in the code; the program is able to self-heal or continue without affecting the entire system itself.
   * **Highly-available** - The system is *ideally* available at all times; the system converges towards an error-free state and is therefore self stabilizing.
   * **Redundancy** - There ~~should~~ will always be multiple identical instances of the system and it will switch to one of the redundant instances in case of failover.
   * **Efficiency** - The above three cost a lot to achieve; my designs are extremely efficient. If there is too much code, complexity, both, or either, I will revert the changes and re-create the system until it is. Being efficient and having all three of the above is a requirement. Until that is achieved my work is not complete.
   * I write about highly efficient, redundant systems [here](https://hakk.gg/how-to-build-a-highly-available-system-using-consensus/) and [here](https://hakk.gg/keep-data-consistency-during-database-migration/).
 * I do a bunch of other stuff regarding **GDPR, CCPA in addition to FINRA, SOX and PCI-DSS** compliance, however, since this is Github, I will leave it at that!

* ðŸ”¬ [I have 66 Research Citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aRS4MOUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) and counting; research is a large part of my life. You might ask, why is it medical research? "*Aren't you a IT*"? (lol) There are no bounds to human knowledge. Learn as much as you can, always! :)

- ðŸ“Œ Iâ€™m working on **enumeration of the mechanism behind Apple's Secure Boot portion of the Secure Enclave Processor [(SEP)](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-overview-sec59b0b31ff/web)**

- ðŸš€ I'm very passionate about **fundamental human rights. Especially the right to privacy. Which is why I founded [GDPR.gg](https://gdpr.gg/).**

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything **related to Google Cloud Platform, GDPR, CCPA, privacy laws, medical research, AWS, auditing firms, governance, and database concurrency!**

- ðŸ“« How to reach me **usa@hakk.me** or **umair@hytech.dev**. I code highly specialized, extremely resilient accounting software built with fraud detection algorithms alongside completing a Master's! I'll be joining a "big 4" accounting firm really soon. 

- âš¡ Fun fact **My initials are USA. Born and raised here. Never left.**
